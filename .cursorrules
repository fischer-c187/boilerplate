# Cursor Rules

## Commit Message Guidelines

When generating commit messages, follow these rules strictly:

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]
```

### Rules
1. **Type** (required): Must be one of:
   - `feat`: New feature
   - `fix`: Bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation only
   - `style`: Code style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
   - `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - `perf`: Performance improvement
   - `test`: Adding or updating tests
   - `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config, etc.)
   - `ci`: CI/CD changes
   - `build`: Build system changes

2. **Scope** (optional): Module or area affected (e.g., `auth`, `database`, `payments`, `ui`)

3. **Subject** (required):
   - Maximum 50 characters
   - Lowercase first letter
   - No period at the end
   - Imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
   - Clear and concise

4. **Body** (optional):
   - Only if additional context is needed
   - Wrap at 72 characters
   - Explain what and why, not how

### Examples
```
feat(auth): add social login with Google
fix(payments): handle webhook retry logic
refactor(database): simplify user query interface
docs: update deployment instructions
chore(deps): upgrade hono to v4.2.0
```

### Anti-patterns (avoid)
```
❌ Added new feature for users
❌ fix: Fixed the bug in the authentication module that was causing issues
❌ Update stuff
❌ WIP
❌ feat: implement comprehensive user authentication system with OAuth2, JWT tokens, and session management
```

### Additional Notes
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change per commit)
- If the subject exceeds 50 chars, you're probably doing too much in one commit
- Breaking changes: Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body or append `!` after type/scope
